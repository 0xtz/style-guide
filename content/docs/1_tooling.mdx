this page ll say my favorite tools and settings for different tools.

like stuff used in projects like (Supabase, shadcn-ui, other OSS)

## What's Tooling?

You might be wondering what tooling means. If you check out the [Bulletproof React's Project Standards](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-standards.md) it describes tools such as ESLint, Prettier, Husky etc.,

yes some stuff like pre-commits can be done now with CI/CD pipelines ikik _details below_.

## Package manager

I use pnpm. you can use npm or yarn. but pnpm is the best for me.

- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## My Favorite Tools

lets start with Vscode the main IDE people uses, if u use NVIM dw just READ.

#### Vscode \*

nothing is wrong with usiong default settings, theme, config etc. this is just personal preference.

but some settings are important to mention.

Eslint, Prettier, Husky, EditorConfig, Better Comments, Error Lens, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, ES7+, Turbo Console Log, SonarQube for IDE.

step 1: install the above extensions.

step 2: go to settings.json and add the following:

```json
{
  // just experiment with it, find what works for you.

  // Recommended settings
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true, // <- thats why you installed prettier extension right?
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": "explicit",
    "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
  },
  "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "modifications"
  // just open google learn more about it. its free dont be scared. its fun.
}
```

step 3: always check project config files.

- .editorconfig
- .prettierrc
- .eslintrc
- tsconfig.json (if you dont find this in the project you are fucked up man ðŸ˜‚)
- etc

#### Husky \*

Husky is a tool that helps you manage git hooks.

> git hooks?

git hooks are scripts that run before or after events in git.

like pre-commit, pre-push, pre-merge, etc.

ok go google the rest of it.

example lets say you have a pre-commit hook that runs prettier on your code.
bc some people in the team dosent know what prettier is.

solutions? just force the format under the hood they ll never notice.

```bash
#! /bin/bash

# this will run prettier on the code ...
pnpm format
```

_whats this ? it dosent work on my machine ?_ Dw u ll figure it out. ðŸ™‚

#### EditorConfig \*

_learn more_

#### ESLint

Find and fix problmes in your JavaScript code.

#### Prettier

Format your code with ease.

this is a very important tool for teams to use.
specially if you care for git commits. and clean changes.

#### Tailwind CSS IntelliSense \* `only if u use tailwind`

Intelligent code completion for Tailwind CSS.

#### ES7+ \*

_learn more_

#### Error Lens

Show errors and warnings in the editor.

so you dont need to go build to see the errors.

#### Better Comments \*

for better comments? what do you want me to say more.

#### Pretty TypeScript Errors \*

no one can read the ts errors dude hhh
so this ll make it easier to read. `just read it pleaes ik you scared of Ts`

#### Turbo Console Log \*

if you are a pro and you debug with console.log u need this.

#### SonarQube for IDE \*

if this show you a yellow squiggle just do what it says.
u ll learn more with time.

## Why ?

just check open source projects.

like [shadcn-ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)

or [supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)

or [vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel)
