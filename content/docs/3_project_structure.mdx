title: Project Structure & Conventions
description: Project Structure & Conventions is a way to manage your project structure and conventions.
---

Here, I focus only on **Next.js** project structure.
This is totally based on my own preferences. **`The file structure.`**

---

## Folder Structure

Let's say we need to build a feature called **users**.
We need:

- A page to **list users**
- A page to **see user details**

**First, just start on a whiteboard.**
Understand the needs **ONLY**. Draw a diagram of the feature.

**Then** start coding.

```bash
|src/
|--/app
|  |-/users
|  |  |_ page.tsx
|  |  |_ loading.tsx <- preferred to have it bc you don't want users to wait...
|  |  |_ error.tsx <- if you trust your code, you can remove it. lol `we'll discuss it later`
|  |  |_/[user_id]
|  |  |_ page.tsx
|  |  |_ ... loading, error, not found, etc
|--/components
|  |-/ui
|  |-/common
|--/lib
|  |-/users // <- separate lib for each feature, so it's clean and easy to maintain
|--/utils // <- common utils
```

See? I didn't start coding yet. I just understood the needs and added the structure.

Now, based on this diagram, we can **start coding, define tables, decide how to fetch data, etc.**

(More about data fetching later.)

## Conventions

- `{...next.js conventions}`

- `/components/common` -> are common components any one can just import and if he wanna add a change or something the other dev can just go to the file and change it, **while** knowing it ll affect all the project.

- `/lib | /features` -> are separated by feature

  - contains utils, hooks?, types, schemas, etc.

- `/public` -> is the folder for the public files, try to not add big files here. `bandwith is expensive`

**⚡ Pro tips**:

- Keep it **as simple as possible** you'll be coming back to it every time you need to change something.
- Don't be afraid to change it. **Stop trying to patch things based on the old structure**—decisions should be made based on the current needs.
- The **whiteboard is your friend** (not literally, but you get the point).
- If you need to change something, **just do it**.
  - But ask yourself first: _Is restructuring the feature **worth it** or not?_
