### commit message

[commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is something important.
in a team no one wanna read your commit/PR code ...

i wanna go check the commit message and know what changed. thats it.

never push 100 files in a single commit.

- what if u need to revert it ?
- what if you need to cherry pick it ?

so split it into smaller commits.

- [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
- [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

> imagine you did a change and some one else comes and for no reason he changed/removed your code in a commit called `fix`, whats your reaction ?

### PRs

if you working in a team you ll create your own branch. `named based on the task / tool ...`
so you ll go to the `main` branch and create a new branch. from this branch you ll create a PR.
after you add your clean commit message and push it to the branch.

> make sure you pull the parent branch before creating a PR.
