# Component Structure

how we should structure our components
so all team members can understand the structure of the components
minimize the time to understand the component structure
minimize changes by other team members ...
clean git history ...

### Imports

```tsx
// Imports are managed by the "Prettier" extension ...
// less  thinking less stress üôÇ
```

### Component `hna lmseggi a m3elem`

```tsx
// ‚¨áÔ∏è compoent must be clear what it does
// ex: "Button" is not clear, "FeatureSubmitButton" is clear ...
// as YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A FUNCTION ok?
export default function ComponentName({
  // ‚¨áÔ∏è props must be clear what it does not just "props" | "data" ...
  title,
}: Readonly<{
  title: string; // this mean the in the usage this is required so we dont pass title=""
}>) {
  // some stuff ll mention later

  return <div />;
}
```

  title,
}: Readonly<{
  title: string; // this mean the in the usage this is required so we dont pass title=""
}>) {
  // ‚¨áÔ∏è state must be clear what it does

  // States
  const [state, setState] = useState<{ SomeType }>({
    // if states are related just put them in one object ...
  });

  // ‚¨áÔ∏è Hooks section we ll have stuff like useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, Forms, Translations, ...

  // Hooks
  const form = useForm();
  const t = useTranslation();
  // ... i think u got the idea

  // ‚ö° now data part
  // where we have queries (i highly recommend to not have forms and queries in the same component if the form needs to use the query data)
  // if you wanna try üòê go ahead

  // Queries
  // just query stuff here as you want  (keep in mind useQuery priorities data fetching)

  // ‚ö° now if we need a mutation (recomeneded to have this in a separate component if possible)

  // Mutations
  // your tipical mutation stuff here

  // Handlers
  // well u know what this is for ...

  //
  return (
    // Haaa here must try to not have unwanted Divs ... like a div > div > div and this can be done ewasely with only one div hhhh
    <div>
      {/* Here needs to say whats that bc when someone is checking he ll read the this and dosent need to check whats indide */}
      <div />

      {/* Content section */}
      <div />

      {/* Footer section */}
      <div />
    </div>
  );

  // like this the others dosent need to read ALL what u did to understand what's going on
  // and if they need to check they can just open the file and see the structure ONLY

  // you can see ther is what i call VISUAL separation
  // this is to make the component more readable nothing more or less its easy to read with eyes
}
```

### Hooks

```tsx
import ...

export default function ComponentName() {
  // Hooks
  const form = useForm();
  const t = useTranslation();
  // ... i think u got the idea

  return <div />;
}
```
