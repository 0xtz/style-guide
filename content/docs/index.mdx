This guide is based on my _little_ experience working on JS/TS projects with different teams, different mentalities, and different experience levels...

## Why This Guide?

I made _tons_ of mistakes, and I tried my best to learn from them.
And listen, I never blamed someone for what they did the first time. **BUT** I _do_ after they've been shown or told the best way to do it and still ignore it 🤷.
`Basically, they think they're good at something, but they're not.`

In this guide, I'll try to cover the best practices I learned from my own failures, the mistakes I had to fix, and the things I _know_ work for a team _small ones at least_.
**especially** for teams where people love to reinvent wheels... I mean, they **don't know** how stuff must be done in production-level apps.

I hope this guide helps you out. And hey, if you have any suggestions or think something is wrong, please let me know.
_so I can tell you why this X decision was made._

## What's Inside?

💡 Best practices I wish I had known earlier.

📁 Folder structures & naming conventions (trust me, they matter).

🚀 Performance optimizations that _actually_ work (Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, etc.).

🔥 Common pitfalls and how to avoid them (learn from my pain and what I learned from others).

🤝 Team collaboration tips (yes, that means code reviews matter).

_(If you're here to argue about semicolons, var vs const and those type of sh\*t, leave now. You still a dumbass.)_
